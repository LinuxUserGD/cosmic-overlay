# cosmic overlay
Overlay for Cosmic desktop environment, developed by System76

- **this is highly in-flux, no guarantees are given**
- done in a best-effort basis to try out the COSMIC DE, likely not representative of the final product if/when shipped in Gentoo

# Libraries
iced and libcosmic were added, but are not really used by the projects due to Rust's building/linking nature.  
Perhaps at a later time COSMIC devs will add a way to link to system libs, but so far it's clear that doing vendor unbundling is a waste of effort.
